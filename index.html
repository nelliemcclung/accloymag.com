We are a blog dedicated to publishing the kind of sentimental and trauma-informed creative work usually rejected by both mainstream and independent publishing projects. We want to hear the story your creative writing instructor told you was too cloying for publication. This is your space: Tell us what happened and tell us why it matters.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-family:Helvetica;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-family:Helvetica;">This is also a collaborative project. Most online literary journals attempt to simulate the experience of reading print magazines, but we want to do things differently. This is first and foremost a blog, curated by us. But, in the interest of moving away from the conventions of content production and into centering authorship and creative practice, we will do our best to represent your work in a way that feels truest to your vision. So just let us know if you have any particular designs, and we will do our best to accommodate you.&nbsp;</span></p>

So long as it meets our editorial standards, we will add it to the blog.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Thank you for reading, thank you for your time, and thank you for your interest in fostering a renewed literary community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
