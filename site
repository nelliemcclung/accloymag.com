<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;line-height:200%;'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>I like how Nabokov understood premonition, tucked under his bedsheets and blankets, scribbling down his thoughts in index cards. For Nabokov, dreams are unmoored, flowing freely in time. Consider: You wake up, you check Twitter, you find out that an atmospheric sinkhole appeared under Nelson, British Columbia, killing four and blocking the only highway between Vancouver and the east. This leads you to remember that, during the night, you dreamed your car veered off the edge of a steep cliff during a heavy storm. In the mind of Nabokov, you do not see into the events of the future, but the opposite; the event happens, and then it comes to visit you in your bed.</span></p>
